I've been following [Thinkster's MEAN Stack Tutorial](https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial) in my free time. It's been a brilliant way to get exposed to the MEAN stack, get a feel for a full-stack development workflow, and to build something interesting and non-trivial.

I haven't finished integrating the final series of steps ([Adding Authentication via Passport](https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial#adding-authentication-via-passport)), though I have already been through the section to distill user authentication into a separate repository for personal reference – it's deceptively involved! I intend to look into [authentication with hapi.js](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/auth), or perhaps digging around for other packages to handle user authentication for me.

There's always more to learn and discover.

## To Use:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Start the database with `mongod`
3. Run `npm start` (or `nodemon` if you have nodemon installed)
